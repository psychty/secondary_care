# Analyses of secondary care data (Hospital Episode Statistics)

This is a repository for commonly used secondary care data analyses using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). It contains SQL code snippets for common queries that can be copied into environments where you have access to HES as well as R scripts for completing analyses and reporting (data visualisation and exporting results).

The repository does not contain any HES data about patients, although there may be dummy datasets used in some places to test out analyses approaches.
