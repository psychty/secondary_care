# https://epirhandbook.com/en/standardised-rates.html  is a useful resource for understanding standardisation

# Fromt he Epi Handbook -

# There are two main ways to standardize: direct and indirect standardization. Letâ€™s say we would like to the standardize mortality rate by age and sex for country A and country B, and compare the standardized rates between these countries.

# For direct standardization, you will have to know the number of the at-risk population and the number of deaths for each stratum of age and sex, for country A and country B. One stratum in our example could be females between ages 15-44.

# For indirect standardization, you only need to know the total number of deaths and the age- and sex structure of each country. This option is therefore feasible if age- and sex-specific mortality rates or population numbers are not available. Indirect standardization is furthermore preferable in case of small numbers per stratum, as estimates in direct standardization would be influenced by substantial sampling variation.

# Age-standardised rates are standardised to the European Standard Population (ESP), a hypothetical population assuming the age structure is the same in both sexes, therefore allowing comparisons to be made between the sexes as well as between areas.
