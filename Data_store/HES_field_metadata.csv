Each of these domains has its own scores and ranks, allowing users to focus on specific aspects of deprivation.

In the PARTYEAR field, the year represents the lower year from the date span, e.g. for 2016-17 the year will appear in this field as 2016 on all records within that data year.

HES extracts are currently taken once per month, with each extract superseding the previous one for that year. For example, a PARTYEAR of 201601 indicates that the data came from the first HES extract to be taken in the 2016-17 data year (April 2016 data only); 201602 is the second extract of 2016-17 (April and May 2016 data only, extracted a month later than the previous extract), etc. 

Where the PARTYEAR ends in 99, this indicates the final HES data set for that year - no further extracts of HES data for that year will be taken, and this data will not change. Where the PARTYEAR does not end in 99, this indicates that the data is provisional and is subject to change with subsequent extracts. Provisional extract numbers generally run from 01 (the first extract of the year) to 13 (the final extract of the year). 99 represents the final data set of the year, which is based on the month 13 extract with additional manual changes made to correct known issues or errors in the data.","YYYYnn = HES year and extract number",NA,NA,NA

Note that the structure of newly allocated organisation codes changed in 2020:

For organisation codes that were allocated prior to October 2020:
Organisations are allocated a main 3-character code which represents the organisation (e.g. an NHS Trust), and 5-character codes to represent sites within that organisation. Sites are allocated the same first 3 characters as the organisation code, with the remaining 2 characters being used to identify the site within that organisation.  For NHS organisations, this field may contain the 3-character organisation code or a full 5-character code (e.g. a site code, a HQ code ending 01 etc.), depending on what was submitted by the provider. Independent providers will always be represented in this field by a 5-character code.

Organisation codes that begin with an '8' represent non-NHS organisations and do not follow the same format - these codes are 5 characters long and cannot be grouped based on the first 3 characters of the code.

For organisation codes allocated from 1st October 2020 onwards:
Organisation codes are 5 characters in length, with an alternating ANANA alphabetic-numeric structure (where ‘A’ represents an alphabetic character, and ‘N’ represents a numeric character). Unlike the previous code structure, these codes cannot be grouped to the first 3-characters to identify the parent organisation code.

The new code structure introduced in 1 October 2020 has only been applied to codes that were registered from this date onwards (codes issued prior to this date will not be replaced with a new format code). A mixture of the different code formats will therefore be present in the data from 2020-21 onwards.","3an or 5an = Provider code

HES extracts are currently taken once per month, with each extract superseding the previous one for that year.

Where the PARTYEAR does not end in 99, this indicates that the data is provisional and is subject to change with subsequent extracts. Provisional extract numbers generally run from 01 (the first extract of the year) to 13 (the final extract of the year). 99 represents the final data set of the year, which is based on the month 13 extract with additional manual changes made to correct known issues or errors in the data.","YYYYnn = HES year and extract number",NA,NA,NA

Note that the structure of newly allocated organisation codes changed in 2020:

For organisation codes that were allocated prior to October 2020:
Organisations are allocated a main 3-character code which represents the organisation (e.g. an NHS Trust), and 5-character codes to represent sites within that organisation. Sites are allocated the same first 3 characters as the organisation code, with the remaining 2 characters being used to identify the site within that organisation.  For NHS organisations, this field may contain the 3-character organisation code or a full 5-character code (e.g. a site code, a HQ code ending 01 etc.), depending on what was submitted by the provider. Independent providers will always be represented in this field by a 5-character code.

Organisation codes that begin with an '8' represent non-NHS organisations and do not follow the same format - these codes are 5 characters long and cannot be grouped based on the first 3 characters of the code.

For organisation codes allocated from 1st October 2020 onwards:
Organisation codes are 5 characters in length, with an alternating ANANA alphabetic-numeric structure (where ‘A’ represents an alphabetic character, and ‘N’ represents a numeric character). Unlike the previous code structure, these codes cannot be grouped to the first 3-characters to identify the parent organisation code.

The new code structure introduced in 1 October 2020 has only been applied to codes that were registered from this date onwards (codes issued prior to this date will not be replaced with a new format code). A mixture of the different code formats will therefore be present in the data from 2020-21 onwards.

See the derived fields PROCODE3 and PROCODET for alternative ways to identify the provider organisation.

Note that the structure of newly allocated organisation codes changed in 2020:

For organisation codes that were allocated prior to October 2020:
Organisations are allocated a main 3-character code which represents the organisation (e.g. an NHS Trust), and 5-character codes to represent sites within that organisation. Sites are allocated the same first 3 characters as the organisation code, with the remaining 2 characters being used to identify the site within that organisation.  For NHS organisations, this field may contain the 3-character organisation code or a full 5-character code (e.g. a site code, a HQ code ending 01 etc.), depending on what was submitted by the provider. Independent providers will always be represented in this field by a 5-character code.

Organisation codes that begin with an '8' represent non-NHS organisations and do not follow the same format - these codes are 5 characters long and cannot be grouped based on the first 3 characters of the code.

For organisation codes allocated from 1st October 2020 onwards:
Organisation codes are 5 characters in length, with an alternating ANANA alphabetic-numeric structure (where ‘A’ represents an alphabetic character, and ‘N’ represents a numeric character). Unlike the previous code structure, these codes cannot be grouped to the first 3-characters to identify the parent organisation code.

The new code structure introduced in 1 October 2020 has only been applied to codes that were registered from this date onwards (codes issued prior to this date will not be replaced with a new format code). A mixture of the different code formats will therefore be present in the data from 2020-21 onwards.","3an or 5an = Provider code
